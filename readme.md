Description: projectNO1:

This is the first time I have created a readme file, so
all the artwork, photos and artwork is original,not the subject, the pic. Critiques are welcome.
   Pertaining to my first Project.
There are 4 pages. Index.html, About.html, contact.html and for now I'm attempting
to create using jQuery or JavaScript a game of dice. It's called 10,000 first one to
ten thousand wins.
