Description: projectNO1:

This is the first time I have created a readme file, so if there is anything funny
I'd like to know. It pertains to my first Project.
There are 4 pages. Index.html, About.html, contact.html and for now I'm attempting 
to create using jQuery or JavaScript a game of dice. It's called 10,000 first one to
ten thousand wins.
